### 👋 Hi there 👋

Hello, my name is Tim and my major is Computer Science. My hobby is working out. Recently, I have been going swimming. 🏊
Anyway, Accident in May 2021, now undergoing rehabilitation. 😀

So many people said, 'It's a miracle...', 'I think you're really normal,' 😂 <br>
but I am trying to walk more and very well. ❤‍🩹

I always say, "I can do it!", "Don't give up."

> 날지 못하면 달려라. 달리지 못하면 걸어라. 그리고 걷지 못하면 기어라, 당신이 무엇을 하든 앞으로 가야 한다는 것만 명심해라. – 마틴 루터 킹 주니어
